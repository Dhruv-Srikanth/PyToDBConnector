# PyToDBConnector
Python code containing queries to access and update database

V1 :-

Points to be noted :-
1) Operations (like <=, + check on them and re and so on) using values taken from SQL query commands are not functioning. Will fix them and resend later. You can use this to see what this program is like)
2) Creation of tables is shown in comments.
3) Command for initialization of house table is given in comments as it needs to be done before the actual program and can be done with creation of table.
4) Database file that is being used "CiscoPrac.db" is a temporary file created on your computer as discussed. In the actual program, we must use a file created using sqlite db browser. Once that is created (let us say "x.db"), put 'x.db' in place of 'CiscoPrac.db'. 
5) I don't think we need the column for grade when we already have standings. Please check on that and get back to me.
6) All values being taken as input are supposed to come from front end.
